## **About the Project**

This **Venue Booking System** is a web-based application that allows users to log in, select a venue, choose a time, and submit a booking request for approval by the admin. It ensures that booking data is well-managed, past bookings are archived, and real-time availability is tracked for each venue.

Key Features:
- **User Authentication**: Users can securely log in with password hashing.
- **Venue Booking**: Choose from various venues and times, and submit a request.
- **Admin Console**: Manage bookings, approve or deny requests, and view past bookings.
- **Database Management**: Uses MySQL for data storage and queries.

The system is designed using Python with **Tkinter** for the front end, **MySQL** for the database backend, and **bcrypt** for password hashing.

    - Python (with Tkinter for GUI)
    - CustomTkinter (for modern UI elements)
- **Backend**:
    - MySQL (for storing user data, bookings, and venues)
    - Python (for backend logic)
- **Database**:
    - MySQL database to store user data, venue details, and booking records.
    - `bcrypt` for password hashing and validation.
- **Libraries**:
    - `customtkinter` (for customizable UI components)
    - `mysql.connector` (to interact with MySQL)
    - `tkinter` (for building the applicationâ€™s interface)
